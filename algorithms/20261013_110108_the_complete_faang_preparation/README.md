# The Complete Faang Preparation

Self-contained **The Complete Faang Preparation** algorithmic primitive written in idiomatic **Rust**. Built from scratch using standard library constructs with zero external dependencies.

### Core Highlights
* **Language & Standard**: Modern `Rust` standard library conventions.
* **Architecture Pattern**: Designed for `Algorithmic Engineering` using `Standard Memory Primitives`.
* **Runtime Overhead**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Concurrency & Safety**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

### Complexity Analysis

| Dimension | Bound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Best Case)** | `O(1)` |
| **Time (Worst Case)** | `O(N log N)` |
| **Auxiliary Space** | `O(N)` |

### Test Suite Execution

Self-contained verification drivers are embedded directly in `main.rs` to validate happy paths, boundary inputs, and invariant preservation.

```bash
rustc -O main.rs -o runner && ./runner
```
