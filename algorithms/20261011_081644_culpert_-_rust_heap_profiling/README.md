# culpert - rust heap profiling with span awareness and regression tooling in Rust

Self-contained **culpert - rust heap profiling with span awareness and regression tooling** algorithmic primitive written in idiomatic **Rust**. Built from scratch using standard library constructs with zero external dependencies.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Algorithmic Engineering`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Standard Memory Primitives`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Contiguous memory layouts and standard collections are favored for straightforward iteration and access.
* **Invariant Integrity**: Execution behavior is validated against nominal workflows and boundary edge cases.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(N)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N)` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
rustc -O main.rs -o runner && ./runner
```
