# Aho-Corasick Multi-Pattern String Searching Automaton in Rust

Core **Rust** implementation for **Aho-Corasick Multi-Pattern String Searching Automaton**, structured for computational clarity, explicit data structures, and deterministic unit test coverage.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Algorithmic Engineering`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Standard Memory Primitives`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Contiguous memory layouts and standard collections are favored for straightforward iteration and access.
* **Invariant Integrity**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(N)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N)` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
rustc -O main.rs -o runner && ./runner
```
