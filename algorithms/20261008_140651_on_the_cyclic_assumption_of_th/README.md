# On the Cyclic Assumption of the Cow-Path Search Algorithm (Rust)

> Core **Rust** implementation for **On the Cyclic Assumption of the Cow-Path Search Algorithm**, structured for computational clarity, explicit data structures, and deterministic unit test coverage.

## Overview & Mechanics

The implementation focuses on the core mathematical properties of **On the Cyclic Assumption of the Cow-Path Search Algorithm**:
* **Data Organization**: Built upon `Standard Memory Primitives` to ensure predictable traversal and storage overhead.
* **Safety Invariants**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Execution Guarantees**: Encapsulates state within isolated data structures, keeping logic self-contained.

## Complexity Profile

* **Time Complexity**:
  * Fast Path (Best): `O(1)`
  * Generalized (Avg / Worst): `O(N)`
* **Space Footprint**: `O(N)` resident heap / stack overhead.

## Verification & Test Scenarios

The test suite in `main.rs` validates:
* Standard operational paths against expected outcomes.
* Extreme values and edge inputs to ensure robust failure handling.
* State stability across sequential and repeated operations.

```bash
# Execute local verification runner
rustc -O main.rs -o runner && ./runner
```
