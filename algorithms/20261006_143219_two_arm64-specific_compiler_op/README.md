# Two ARM64-specific compiler optimization bugs, in GCC 15/16 and Rust, hit curl in Rust

A clean, dependency-free **Rust** reference implementation of **Two ARM64-specific compiler optimization bugs, in GCC 15/16 and Rust, hit curl**, focused on core algorithmic mechanics, clear memory layout, and test verification.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Algorithmic Engineering`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Standard Memory Primitives`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Memory allocations are kept minimal to maintain clear data locality and predictable memory bounds.
* **Invariant Integrity**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(N)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N)` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
rustc -O main.rs -o runner && ./runner
```
