# Verge (Rust)

> An in-memory reference implementation of **Verge** in **Rust**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

## Overview & Mechanics

The implementation focuses on the core mathematical properties of **Verge**:
* **Data Organization**: Built upon `Standard Memory Primitives` to ensure predictable traversal and storage overhead.
* **Safety Invariants**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Execution Guarantees**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

## Complexity Profile

* **Time Complexity**:
  * Fast Path (Best): `O(1)`
  * Generalized (Avg / Worst): `O(N)`
* **Space Footprint**: `O(N)` resident heap / stack overhead.

## Verification & Test Scenarios

The test suite in `main.rs` validates:
* Standard operational paths against expected outcomes.
* Extreme values and edge inputs to ensure robust failure handling.
* State stability across sequential and repeated operations.

```bash
# Execute local verification runner
rustc -O main.rs -o runner && ./runner
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `Verge` in `Rust`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
